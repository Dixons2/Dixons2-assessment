    <p class="paragraph1">Wooden Hand Clubs
        Before Europeans and European weapons arrived in Aotearoa, Māori warfare
         mainly involved hand-to-hand combat. Warriors used many different hand 
         weapons, including taiaha (fighting staffs), pouwhenua (pointed staffs)
         , tewhatewha (axe-like staffs), tao (short spears), huata (long spears)
          and patu (clubs). The long weapons were carried, and the small clubs 
          were often tucked into a belt. Special weapons were sometimes given 
          names and passed down through generations.
        Wars could be fought over land and resources, but also as utu (revenge) 
        or to increase mana (prestige). There were many traditions and rules to 
        be followed during battles in earlier times. War parties (taua) could 
        range in size from a small group to a few hundred people. Most battles 
        took place in the summer months after the harvesting of crops was 
        completed. The element of surprise was important, so raids often 
        happened at dawn.
        Though there were deaths and injuries as a result of skirmishes in 
        pre-European times, the numbers were very small in comparison to the 
        slaughter that occurred when muskets became available.
