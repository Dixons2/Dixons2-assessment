    <p class="paragraph1">Wooden Hand Clubs
        Before Europeans and European weapons arrived in Aotearoa, Māori warfare
         mainly involved hand-to-hand combat. Warriors used many different hand 
         weapons, including taiaha (fighting staffs), pouwhenua (pointed staffs)
         , tewhatewha (axe-like staffs), tao (short spears), huata (long spears)
          and patu (clubs). The long weapons were carried, and the small clubs 
          were often tucked into a belt. Special weapons were sometimes given 
          names and passed down through generations.
        Wars could be fought over land and resources, but also as utu (revenge) 
        or to increase mana (prestige). There were many traditions and rules to 
        be followed during battles in earlier times. War parties (taua) could 
        range in size from a small group to a few hundred people. Most battles 
        took place in the summer months after the harvesting of crops was 
        completed. The element of surprise was important, so raids often 
        happened at dawn.
        Though there were deaths and injuries as a result of skirmishes in 
        pre-European times, the numbers were very small in comparison to the 
        slaughter that occurred when muskets became available.

    <p class="paragraph2">National Carving School – Te Wānanga Whakairo
        In 1967, the first intake to the National Carving School began the task 
        of learning the disciplines of their Māori ancestors. Among those 
        students was Clive Fugill, the man who would become master carver of the
         institute today.
        “I’ll never forget that first day,” says Clive, “Our master carver, 
        Hone Taiapa, looked at us all and said, “you are here to learn the art 
        to pass it on to generations. Keep it alive for we could lose our 
        identity.” It was exciting to be playing such an important role to save 
        Māori art,” says Clive, “everyone has a reason in life. This was my 
        reason. And that’s why I’m still here over 40 years later. If we lose 
        our arts and crafts we lose our identity.”
        Today fulltime carving students study for three years at the national 
        carving school, under the guidance of those, such as Clive Fugill and 
        James Rickard, master carvers at Te Puia who were once institute carving
         students themselves.
        The protruding tongue, as used in the haka (war dance), is intended as 
        a symbol of defiance, determination and strength, however in many 
        carvings it can also symbolize the oral nature in which information was
         passed on from generation to generation.
        Here at Te Puia we offer you the chance to take away traditional Māori
         carvings; beautiful handcrafted pieces made at our National Carving 
         School. Look for the Te Puia Official Mark of Authenticity. We also 
         accept carving commissions.
