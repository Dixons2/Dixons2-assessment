    <p class="paragraph1">National Weaving School (Te Rito)
        Harakeke (Flax) is unique to New Zealand and is one of our most ancient 
        plant species. 
        When our ancestors arrived to New Zealand they quickly discovered that 
        flax could be woven to make clothing, housing materials and decorative 
        tūrapa (panels) for their houses.
        Two native species of flax both come from the lily family. Harakeke 
        (common flax) grows up to three meters high and has firm, long leaves 
        with a fine muka fibre, ideal for all types of weaving. Wharariki 
        (mountain flax) is found along coast lines, growing up to 1.6 meters 
        with softer leaves and less fibre than harakeke.
        At the National Weaving school, students are taught the skills and 
        traditions of a craft hundreds of years old. “I believe weaving can 
        only be learnt the old way - by sitting, by listening, by touching 
        and by doing,” says head of the weaving school, Edna Pahewa.
        As well as learning how to weave harakeke (flax) and other materials, 
        students learn the stories and designs unique to each iwi (tribe), as 
        well as the Māori protocols associated with weaving. These include 
        planting according to the phases of the moon and reciting prayers of 
        thanks for flax and trees used.
        Te Rito is named after the baby shoot that sits deep at the heart of 
        the flax. That baby is protected by two outside shoots, the mother and 
        father. Students learn never to touch the inner three shoots when 
        cutting the flax as they are the nucleus - the family unit too precious 
        to be broken. Without these shoots, the flax will lose its identity.
        Māori used various art forms to record their histories and stories, 
        preserving them for future generations. Weaving patterns and styles were
         designed to symbolise particular stories and these were handed down 
         within a family or tribe.

    <p class="paragraph3">Pohutu Geyser
        Our main geyser is called “Pohutu” which means “Big splash” and erupts 
        up to heights of 30 meters. Pohutu is semi-predictable, as she plays 
        15-20 minutes after another of our active geysers. According to Maori 
        culture, geysers are viewed as gifts from the gods
        To the left of Pohutu (when viewing from the bridge) is the “Prince of 
        Wales Feathers” Geyser – named after Prince Edward Albert visited here 
        in the 1900’s. It was traditionally named the “Tohu” or sign as it 
        usually plays 10 mins before and then simultaneously with Pohutu and 
        reaches heights of up to seven metres (almost 23 feet).
        The “Kererū” Geyser erupts every few days from the blackened crater 
        closest to Puarenga Stream. The fan-shaped jet can reach heights of up 
        to 15 metres (just over 49 feet). It is named after the New Zealand 
        Pigeon.
        Geysers act like a giant pressure cooker on earth, shooting boiling 
        water and steam into the air.
        All geysers have three components; an intensive heat source, a constant
         supply of water and an underground plumbing system.
        As rainfall fills the intricate plumbing system below the earth’s 
        surface, molten rock rapidly heats the water.
        The water is under significant pressure causing the boiling point to be
         well over 125 degrees Celsius.
        As pockets of water become turbulent, the pressure is relieved by 
        violently shooting steam and water into the air with tremendous force.
