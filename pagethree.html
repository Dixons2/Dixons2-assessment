    <p class="paragraph1">Mud pool
        The mud pool is the result of acid gases and steam that cause the 
        decomposition of minerals (feldspars) to form a clay called kaolin. 
        Kaolin is white when pure, but finely divided black sulphur turns it to 
        grey.
        The activity varies with the amount of rainfall, but the temperature of 
        the steaming bursts of mud is approximately 90-95 degrees Celsius 
        (194-203 degrees Fahrenheit).
        This mud pool is also known as the “Frog Pool” because of the similarity
         between the plopping mud and leaping frogs.
        Some pools contain mud with medicinal properties that are used to treat
         skin, rheumatic and arthritic ailments. Māori traditionally used the 
         mud to treat stomach infections by mixing a small amount with water and
          drinking it.
        Mud pools are created in areas that have limited hot water, but abundant
         supplies of steam and rock.
        That “pongy” smell Rotorua is famous for is due to hydrogen sulphide 
        released by geothermal features. When released into the air, the 
        hydrogen sulphide reacts with oxygen, creating sulphuric acid. This 
        acid has the ability to dissolve rock into fine particles of silica and
         clay, and when combined with a small supply of water, a mud pool is 
         created.

    <p class="paragraph2">Geothermal Valley
There are over 500 pools and 65 geyser vents, each with their own name, are 
found in the 70 hectare Te Whakarewarewa geothermal valley in Rotorua.
Our traditional Maori explanation of Te Whakarewarewa Geothermal Valley states 
that this place was one of the area’s ‘Te Pupu’ and ‘Te Hoata’, the Goddesses of
 Fire, emerged from the earth’s core while trying to find their brother 
 Ngātoro-i-rangi, who was stranded on Mount Tongariro. As they rose to the 
 surface looking for their brother, they left part of the fire they carried, 
 creating geysers, hot springs and mud pools, creating the geothermal activity 
 that remains today.
